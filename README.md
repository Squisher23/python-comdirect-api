# python-comdirect-api

This is a Python implementation of the new [comdirect REST API](https://www.comdirect.de/cms/kontakt-zugaenge-api.html). This API can be used to interact with the German bank comdirect and view your balances and transactions. The technical specification of the API (in German) is found [here](https://kunde.comdirect.de/cms/media/comdirect_REST_API_Dokumentation.pdf).

Currently, only parts of this comdirect API are implemented.
Parts which are already implemented and work:

- ACCOUNT (partially)

Still to do:

- QUOTE
- ORDER
- INSTRUMENT
- DEPOT
