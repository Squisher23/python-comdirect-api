# python-comdirect-api

This is a Python implementation of the new [comdirect REST API](https://www.comdirect.de/cms/kontakt-zugaenge-api.html). This API can be used to interact with the German bank comdirect and view your balances and transactions. The technical specification of the API (in German) is found [here](https://kunde.comdirect.de/cms/media/comdirect_REST_API_Dokumentation.pdf).

Currently, this is only a proof of concept, but I plan to make it more useable and maybe turn it into a Python module.
